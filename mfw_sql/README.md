**Note:** This resource is still a work in progress. You must keep `mythic-inventory` running alongside it for now, as not all callback functions and components have been fully converted yet. Polyzone and NPC inventory interactions should work the same as in Mythic, but full standalone support is not finished. If you can help with converting callback functions in `ox_inventory/modules/bridge/mythic/server.lua`, contributions are welcome!
